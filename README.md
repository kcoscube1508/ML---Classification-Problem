#Extract Features
 ##Features and target should not have null values
 ##Features should be numeric in nature
 ##Features should be of the type array/dataframes
 ##Features should have some rows and columns.
===========================================================
#Split the dataset into training and testing datasets
 ##Features should be on the same scale
===========================================================
